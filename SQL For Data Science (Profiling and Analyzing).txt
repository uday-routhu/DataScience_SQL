Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000

Including code I have executed against:
Select count(*) as num_of_records from Attribute;
Note: I ran similar for other tables
	
2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10,000
viii. Tip =  537   #specified user_id
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	
 Code: select count(distinct id) from Business ; 
Note: I ran similar for other tables


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: Zero rows in the answer shows that there is no null values in the User table
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
           select id, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute,      compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos from user where id = NULL or name = NULL or review_count = NULL or yelping_since = NULL or useful = NULL or funny = NULL or cool = NULL or fans= NULL or average_stars= NULL or compliment_hot= NULL or compliment_more= NULL or compliment_profile= NULL or compliment_cute= NULL or compliment_list= NULL or compliment_note= NULL or compliment_plain = NULL or compliment_cool= NULL or compliment_funny= NULL or compliment_writer= NULL or compliment_photos= NULL;

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
		min:1		max:5		avg:3.7082

	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549

	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144

	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:  1.9414

	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995		
              code: select min(stars),max(stars), avg(stars) from review; 
             Note: I ran similar for other tables

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

    Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
    Ans: Based on the provided output, we can observe that some users who have posted more    reviews also tend to have more fans, but this does not necessarily imply a direct correlation between the two factors for all users.

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?
Answer: total number of reviews 10000, out of that only got 1958 reviews with the word “love” or “hate”
However only love reviews are 1780 and only hate reviews are 232 so compared hate hate, love reviews are more
select
count(text) as "love_or_hate_reviews" from review where text LIKE '%love%' ;

select
count(text) as "love_or_hate_reviews" from review where text LIKE '%hate%' ;

SQL code used to arrive at answer:
select
id,count(text) from review where text LIKE '%love%' OR text LIKE '%hate%';

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1.	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

Category='Shopping'
City = 'Las Vegas'
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
  Ans: Yes
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Ans: Yes        
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
    Businesses with higher star ratings (4.5 and 5.0) seem to be more popular and have longer hours of operation compared to those with lower star ratings (2.5 and 3.5). Customers may prefer businesses with higher ratings and more reviews, leading to increased popularity and longer

  SQL code used for analysis:
        select city,stars,count(*) as total_businesses,
        SUM(review_count) as total_review_business,inr.hours
        from business out
        JOIN 
        (select a.business_id,category,hours 
        from category a 
        JOIN hours b 
        ON a.business_id = b.business_id
        where a.category = 'Shopping') inr 
        ON out.id = inr.business_id
        WHERE out.city='Las Vegas'
        GROUP BY city,stars,inr.hours;

	
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         Open businesses (8,480) outnumber closed businesses (1,520) by a considerable margin. This suggests that there is a higher demand for services provided by open businesses compared to closed ones. Customers may have more options and greater accessibility to services offered by open businesses.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         The large disparity in the number of open and closed businesses indicates the economic activity within the area. Higher numbers of open businesses suggest a vibrant and thriving economy, while a significant number of closed businesses may indicate economic challenges or shifts in market dynamics. This difference in business status could have implications for employment rates, local spending, and overall economic health.
         
SQL code used for analysis:




select 
 CASE 
    WHEN is_open = 1 THEN 'OPEN'
    ELSE 'CLOSED'
 END as business_status,
 count(*) as total_business
 from business
 Group BY is_open

	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i.	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Ans: predicting the overall star rating for business
        
ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

Trend Analysis: You can observe how the average review count and average is_open status change as the overall star rating increases. This can help identify trends in customer behavior and business performance.
Customer Behavior Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between review counts and star ratings can provide insights into customer behavior and preferences. Businesses with higher star ratings may attract more reviews, indicating a higher level of customer engagement.
Impact of Open Status: Analyzing the average is_open status across different star ratings can reveal how business openness correlates with star ratings. For example, businesses with higher star ratings may have a higher likelihood of being open.
                           
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         +--------------------+--------------------+---------------------+
